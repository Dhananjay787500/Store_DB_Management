# 🏪 SQL Data Analyst Project - Store Database Management System

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Store Database Management System** is a two-phase SQL-based project designed to manage and analyze store operations efficiently.  
It helps businesses track **sales, inventory, staff performance, and customer behavior** using a well-structured relational database.

---

## 📂 Project Phases

### **Phase 1 — Database Design & Development**
**Objective:**  
To develop a structured relational database that manages key store operations such as inventory, staff, customers, and orders.

**Key Features:**
- Centralized storage for store, product, and customer data  
- Tracks orders and associated order items  
- Maintains accurate stock levels across multiple stores  
- Supports staff hierarchy (manager–staff relationships)  
- Ensures data integrity through relational constraints  

**Main Tables:**
- `stores` – Store details and locations  
- `staffs` – Employee information and reporting structure  
- `products` – Product details including brand, category, and pricing  
- `brands` – Brand metadata  
- `categories` – Product classification  
- `customers` – Customer contact and address details  
- `orders` – Order header information  
- `order_items` – Order-level product details  
- `stocks` – Store-wise product inventory

### **Phase 2 — Analytical SQL Reports**
**Objective:**  
To build analytical and reporting capabilities on top of the existing database structure for business decision-making.

**Key Analytical Insights:**
#### 🛒 Sales Analysis
- Total revenue generated by each store  
- Top 5 best-selling products  
- Monthly sales trends and seasonal insights  
- Top-selling product per category  
- Running total of product sales  

#### 👥 Customer Analysis
- Top customers by total purchases  
- Inactive customers (no orders)  
- Loyal customers (≥3 orders and ≥$25,000 spent)

#### 📦 Inventory Management
- Identify low-stock products (below 50 items)  

#### 👨‍💼 Employee Performance
- Top 5 employees by orders handled  
- Staff ranking based on revenue generated  
- Employee order transaction insights  

#### 📈 Advanced Reporting
- Rank products by sales volume  
- Compare monthly sales with previous month  
- Assign row numbers to orders per customer
